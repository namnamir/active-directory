# Scripts for Active Directory
Here will be scripts reading, alerting, or modifying *Active Directory* parameters. I am not a PowerShell expert, so scripts may look very basic but these scripts have saved my life. I decided to share them with other, may solve their issues or save their time.

## List of Scripts
